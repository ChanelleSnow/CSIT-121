            <p>This is my official first blog! It took a lot of trial and error, because I am still trying to understand the tags.
                I think I am still gettting the hang of the html structures.
                 Even though I am just beginning to learn html, this is really fun!</p>
                 <h3>What I learned</h3>
                 <ol>
                    <li>  You must declare all document html before coding </li>

                    <li> There are 6 Headings</li>          

                    <li> The File must be validated before published</li>        
                 </ol>
                 <p>From hand coding a html file, to validating the file and learning how to publish the html file is exciting.
                    
                    <ul>I learned alot from:</ul>
                        <li>How to publish an html page</li>
                        <li>What will your webpage look like resource page</li>

        <p>This chapter we learned CSS styles, the basic ways to style html. I learned how to
            change the background color, font size and text style. I still have a lot to learn.
