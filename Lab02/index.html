            <main>This is my official first blog! It took a lot of trail and error, because I am still trying to understand the tags.
                I think I am still gettting the hang of the html structures.
                 Even though I am just beginning to learn html, this is really fun!</main>
                 <h3>What I learned</h3>
                 <article>  1.You must declare all document html before coding </article>

                  <article> 2.There are 6 Headings</article>          

                   <article>3.The File must be validated before published</article>
